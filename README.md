# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To Present 2 different UX project scenarios 

## Algorithm:

1.Identify user pain points through interviews, surveys, and real-world observation.
2.Define UX problem statements based on specific user needs.
3.Choose suitable research methods:
Health App: Interviews, Surveys, Usability Testing.
Gov Portal: Contextual Inquiry, Heuristic Evaluation, Surveys.
4.Create user personas to represent typical users and their goals.
5.Use insights to inform design improvements for usability, personalization, and accessibility.

## Output:
Scenario 1: Designing a Health App for Chronic Condition Management
1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements
User Pain Points:
•	Users forget to take medication regularly.
•	They struggle to keep track of symptoms and triggers.
•	Existing apps are too complex or medical-jargon-heavy.
Problem Statements:
1.	"Adults with chronic conditions need a way to track their daily symptoms and medication intake because they often forget or lose track due to busy schedules, which results in missed doses and poor condition management."
2.	"Users need a way to understand and visualize their health trends over time because current tools lack personalization, which results in limited engagement and inconsistent health monitoring."
